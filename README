This is jQuery iFrame, a plugin to help you set iframe source and squirt HTML content into iframes, by Michael Mahemoff, under MIT License. It gives you a callback so you know when the frame has been loaded, tells you how long it took to load, and provides timeout support. Full API and interactive demo at:

To use it, all you need is js/jquery.iframe.js
